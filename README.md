## Background
This project was developed in one week's time and is meant to mimic a client management system that might be used by a busy sales professional on a day to day basis. 

The project includes space for tracking contact information, the ability to edit and add new contacts as needed, as well as a to-do list feature, and space to add and read conversations had with a specific client. These features allow for professionals to seamlessly track basic client information in one application. 

This CRUD application was developed using RESTful architecture principles and MEN stack technologies (MongoDB, ExpressJS & Node.js)
